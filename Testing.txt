--JUnit Testing--
You can just import the project in Bricktionary/tests/ into Eclipse to get started, since I already set it up.
Make sure to set run configuration to run the entire package, rather than running every class separately.

--EMMA code coverage--
Originally got instructions from here, see "Detailed Instructions to run EMMA" below instead, since I have it mostly set up already:
http://groups.google.com/group/android-developers/browse_thread/thread/43cf8a8ca5662f85/fc748e53f26ba3b0
1. If you already have an existing main project and test project; run
'android update project' and on both your existing and test project
2. Otherwise, run 'android create project' and 'android create test-project'
to create new projects
3. Create an AVD for the Android 2.0 platform if you haven't already, and
launch an emulator for this AVD
4. cd to the <path of your test-project>
5. Run 'ant coverage' 

--Detailed instructions to run EMMA--
Make sure you have an up to date SDK. Older Android SDKs may not support the needed "ant coverage" command

Make sure these are in your path variable already
android-sdk-directory\tools
android-sdk-directory\tools\ant

Setup ant:

http://ant.apache.org/manual/install.html

Patch up your android-sdk-directory/platform-tools/dx.bat to handle issue with spaces in directory names with ant:
http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=4567#c11
Change line 50 from:
set params=%*
to:
set params=%*
set params=%params:"=""%
Change ending line from:
call java %javaOpts% -Djava.ext.dirs=%frameworkdir% -jar %jarpath% %args%
To:
set args=%args:""="%
call java %javaOpts% -Djava.ext.dirs=%frameworkdir% -jar %jarpath% %args%

In a command window:
(might have to run "android update project" on both first, but since I uploaded the build.xml files already to the repo, you likely don't).
Start AVD running Android 2.1 (you can do so using the Android SDK and AVD Manager in eclipse)
cd into your test-project directory (Bricktionary/tests)
run 'ant coverage'
